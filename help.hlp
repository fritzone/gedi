[file_ops]
**## File Operations ##**

All file operations are available under the **File** menu (**Alt+F**).

* **New** (**Ctrl+N**): Creates a new, empty buffer with a default name (e.g., `noname00.cpp`).

* **Open** (**Ctrl+O**): Opens the file browser dialog to select a file from your system. The browser shows file details like permissions, size, and modification date.

* **Save** (**Ctrl+S**): Saves the current file. If the file is new, it will open the "Save As" browser.

* **Save As...**: Opens the file browser, allowing you to save the current buffer to a new file or location.

* **Exit** (**Alt+X**): Closes the editor. You will be prompted to save any unsaved changes.

[editing]
**## Editing and Selection ##**

Standard text editing is enhanced with clipboard operations, undo/redo, and a powerful comment toggle. Most features are in the **Edit** menu (**Alt+E**).

* **Undo** (**Alt+Backspace**): Reverts the last change made to the text.
* **Redo** (**Alt+Y**): Re-applies an action that was just undone.
* **Cut/Copy/Paste** (**Ctrl+X**, **Ctrl+C**, **Ctrl+V**): Uses the system clipboard for integration with other applications.

**Selection:**
Text can be selected using **Shift + Arrow Keys** (or Home/End, PageUp/Down). Most editing commands, like Cut, Copy, and Comment, operate on the selected text. Press **Escape** to clear a selection.

**Toggle Comment** (**Ctrl+/**):
This is a smart comment/uncomment feature.
* **No Selection**: It adds or removes a C++ style (`//`) comment at the beginning of the current line.
* **With Selection**: It adds or removes a `//` comment from **every** line within the selection. This is useful for commenting out large blocks of code.

[navigation]
**## Navigation and Search ##**

Quickly move through your code and find what you're looking for using these tools, available in the **Search** menu (**Alt+S**).

**Cursor Movement:**
* **Ctrl+Left/Right**: Move by one word at a time.
* **Ctrl+Up/Down**: Move to the previous/next empty line, effectively jumping between paragraphs or code blocks.
* **Home/End**: Move to the absolute start or end of the current line's text.

**Search and Replace:**
* **Find** (**Ctrl+F**): Opens a search prompt in the status bar. As you type, the editor will highlight the next match. Press **Enter** to jump to it or **Escape** to cancel.
* **Replace** (**Ctrl+R**): Opens a dialog to find text and replace it with something else, one instance at a time or all at once.
* **Go To Line...**: Opens a dialog prompting for a line number to jump to directly.

[building]
**## Compiling and Running ##**

The editor provides a powerful, integrated build system, available in the **Build** menu (**Alt+B**).

The system uses the `cguess.py` script to automatically detect dependencies and generate a build command. For efficiency, this command is **cached** for each file and is only regenerated when you save the file.

* **Compile Only** (**Shift+F9**): Compiles the current file. A dialog will pop up showing the live output from the compiler. If there are errors, a navigable error list will appear at the bottom of the screen.

* **Compile and Run** (**F9**): First compiles the file. If successful, it then runs the resulting executable and displays its output in a full-screen view.

* **Compile Options...**: Opens a detailed dialog where you can configure the build process:
    * **Mode**: Choose between **Debug** (`-g`) and **Release** (`-O3 -DNDEBUG`).
    * **Optimization**: Manually set the optimization level from -O0 to -Os.
    * **Security**: Toggle common security flags like Stack Protectors and PIE.
    * **Optional Flags**: Add any other flags (`-Wall`, `-lm`, etc.) to the command.
    These settings are saved in `config.json`.

[windows]
**## Window Management ##**

Manage multiple open files and view program output from the **Window** menu (**Alt+W**).

* **Output Screen** (**F5**): Toggles the full-screen view that shows the output of your program after running it with **F9**. Press any key to return to the editor.

* **Next Window** (**F6**): Switch focus to the next open file buffer.
* **Previous Window** (**Shift+F6**): Switch focus to the previous open file buffer.

* **Close Window** (**Alt+W**): Closes the currently active file. You will be prompted to save if there are unsaved changes.

* **Window List** (**Alt+1**, **Alt+2**, etc.): The Window menu contains a dynamic list of all open files. You can quickly switch to a specific file using its corresponding Alt+Number hotkey.

Return to [[main|Main Menu]].

[options]
**## Configuration Options ##**

Customize the editor's behavior via the **Editor Settings** dialog, found in the **Options** menu (**Alt+O**).

The settings dialog allows you to configure:
* **Smart Indentation**: Automatically indents the next line after you type an opening brace `{`.
* **Tab Size**: Set the number of spaces inserted when you press the Tab key.
* **Show Line Numbers**: Toggle the visibility of the line number gutter on the left side of the editor.
* **Color Scheme**: Choose from available themes defined in `colors.json`.

Your preferences are automatically saved to `config.json` when you click **Save**.
